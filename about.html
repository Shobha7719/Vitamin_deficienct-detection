    <h2>About VitaDetect</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Our mission to empower your health journey with cutting-edge technology.</p>
    
    <div class="info-card">
        <h3>Our Story: A Vision for Accessible Health</h3>
        <p>VitaDetect was born from a shared passion for leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to address a fundamental health challenge: the early detection of nutritional deficiencies. We observed that traditional methods for identifying these imbalances were often cumbersome, expensive, or simply inaccessible to many. This realization sparked an idea: what if we could create an intuitive, convenient, and reliable tool that empowers individuals to gain insights into their nutritional health, right from their devices?</p>
        <p>Our diverse team, comprising leading AI specialists, seasoned health professionals, and dedicated software engineers, united with a common goal. We set out to bridge the gap between complex medical diagnostics and everyday personal health management. VitaDetect is the result of countless hours of research, development, and a steadfast belief that technology can democratize access to vital health information, fostering a healthier, more informed global community.</p>

        <h3>Our Vision: Pioneering Proactive Wellness</h3>
        <p>We aspire to be the vanguard AI-powered platform for preliminary health assessments, with a focused initial commitment to vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Our vision extends to a future where every individual possesses the tools to effortlessly monitor their nutritional status. This enables proactive decision-making towards cultivating a balanced diet and embracing a holistic healthier lifestyle, all seamlessly integrated into their daily routine through the convenience of their smartphone or computer.</p>

        <h3>The Technology Behind VitaDetect: Smart, Secure, and Scientific</h3>
        <p>At the core of VitaDetect is a sophisticated Artificial Intelligence engine, meticulously trained on extensive datasets of health and nutritional information. Our algorithms analyze the symptoms you input, cross-referencing them with known patterns of vitamin and mineral deficiencies.</p>
        <p>We employ advanced machine learning techniques, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> To accurately interpret your symptom descriptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Pattern Recognition Algorithms:</strong> To identify correlations between your inputs and specific deficiencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> To offer preliminary insights and potential areas of concern.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our system is continuously learning and improving, thanks to ongoing research and development by our expert team. While VitaDetect provides valuable preliminary assessments, it is designed to be a supportive tool, not a replacement for professional medical advice.</p>
